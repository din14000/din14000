Hi! My name is Din ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm interested in front and back end development in the cloud era!
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning more about full-stack development using Java, JavaScript, Spring framework and Angular (also worked with RoR, React and Vanilla JS using external APIs)
âœ¨ I have finished a Full-Stack (Java+Spring+Angular) course at JohnBryce and loved it!
